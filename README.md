# MCGL
OpenGL for Swift: Bridged Constants

This repo provides bridgin constants for OpenGL in Swift. This is an initial attempt with the constant so that they do not have to be manually casted. Please provide any pull requests if any constant is of the wrong type and has to be cast manually. Currently working on adding the constants from the other OpenGL files.

To use module, add repo as a dependency in your Package.swift file, then use "import MCGL" on required files. Use in conjunction with "import OpenGL" for full access to libraries.

Thank you for your cooperation! Happy coding!
